# ControlT

This Mac OS X application has a single purpose: it registers control-T as a universal hot key to launch the Terminal. The app is designed to be ultra-light-weight in its footprint and use of system resources.

When launched, ControlT will not appear in the dock, but will add a small status menu to the Mac OS menu bar. This menu can be used to quit ControlT.
